# get_next_line
Get_next_line is the first algorithmic project in the 42 cursus.
This simple program will read the content of a file within the buffer size you have defined at compilation.
The return values are:
* -1 if an error happened.
* 0 if nothing has been read, or EOF has been reached.
* 1 if a line has been read.
More details are available in the subject attached.
